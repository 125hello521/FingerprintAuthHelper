# Usage
##### Add the dependencies to your gradle file:
```sh
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.pro100svitlo:fingerprintAuthHelper:1.1.2'
    }
```

##### Inside your activity or fragment:

```sh

    private FingerprintAuthHelper mFAH;
    private FahSecureSettingsDialog mSecureSettingsDialog;
    
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    ...
        mFAH = new FingerprintAuthHelper.Builder(this, this)
                .build();

        if (mFAH.isHardwareEnable()){
            //do some stuff here
        } else {
            //otherwise do
        }
    }
    
    ...
    
   @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        mFAH.startListening();
    }
 
    ...
    
    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        mFAH.stopListening();
    }
 
    ...
    
    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        mFAH.onDestroy();
    }
```
That's pretty much all what you need to start the work!

### Callbacks:

Your activity or fragment must implement FahListener;
 
```sh
    @Override
    public void onFingerprintStatus(boolean authSuccessful, int errorType, CharSequence errorMess) {
        if (authSuccessful){
            // do some stuff here in case auth was successfull
        } else if (mFAH != null){
          // do some stuff here in case auth failed
            switch (errorType){
                case FahErrorType.General.LOCK_SCREEN_DISABLED:
                case FahErrorType.General.NO_FINGERPRINTS:
                    if (mSecureSettingsDialog == null){
                        mSecureSettingsDialog = new FahSecureSettingsDialog.Builder(this, mFAH).build();
                    }
                    mSecureSettingsDialog.show();
                    break;
                case FahErrorType.Auth.AUTH_NOT_RECOGNIZED:
                    //do some stuff here
                    break;
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onFingerprintListening(boolean listening, long milliseconds) {
        if (listening){
            //add some code here
        } else {
            //add some code here
        }
        if (milliseconds > 0) {
            //if u need, u can show timeout for user
        }
    }
```
